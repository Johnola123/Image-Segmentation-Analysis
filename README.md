Image Segmentation Analysis using Neural Network


Summary of Steps:

Data loading and preprocessing using pandas and LabelEncoder.

Feature selection and train-test split using sklearn.

Model training using a decision tree classifier.

Evaluation via accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Visual representation of the tree using plot_tree.

Final Result:

Achieved an accuracy of ~92.6% on the test set.

Classification report and confusion matrix confirm good performance across classes.
